# Bine

Under development. Goals:

* Golang equivalent of https://stem.torproject.org/ (e.g. a maintained https://github.com/yawning/bulb)
* Support everything Stem supports
* Provide Golang abstractions (net.Conn, net.Listener) on onion services
* Key generation utilities
* Support statically compiled Tor (akin to how I did https://github.com/cretz/rtsw-poc)
